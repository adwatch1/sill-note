![Sill Note](screenshots/01-edge-panel.png)

**A free notes panel that lives on the edge of your Windows screen.**
Move your mouse to the right edge and a panel slides in, over any window. Move away and it slides back out. No account, no cloud, no tracking.

**[⬇ Download for Windows](https://github.com/adwatch1/sill-note/releases/latest/download/SillNote-Setup.exe)** · **[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P57P0K20CT9)** · **[Website](https://www.sillnote.store/)**

## Features

- **Edge trigger.** Rest the mouse on the middle of the right screen edge, or press `Ctrl + Alt + N`.
- **Two levels of tabs.** Topics across the top, notes on the left. Color, rename and reorder them.
- **Notes that save themselves.** No save button.
- **Images.** Drag and drop, paste with `Ctrl + V`, or right-click → Add image.
- **Audio & voice notes.** Drop audio files, or record from your microphone with a live waveform.
- **YouTube cards.** Paste a YouTube link and it becomes a card with the thumbnail and title.
- **10 languages.** Follows your Windows language automatically.
- **Hide from screen sharing.** One switch and Sill Note disappears from screen recordings, screen sharing (Zoom, Teams, Discord, OBS) and screenshots — while you still see it.
- **Opacity.** Make the panel background see-through (60–100 %); text and images stay sharp.
- **Focus view.** Hide the note list with the sidebar button so your note fills the panel.
- Light and dark themes, pin to keep open, resizable panel, start with Windows.

## Install

Download `SillNote-Setup.exe` from [Releases](../../releases/latest) and run it (no administrator rights needed). The direct download isn’t code-signed yet, so Windows may warn the first time: **More info → Run anyway**. The [Microsoft Store version](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P57P0K20CT9) is signed by Microsoft and updates itself. Prefer not to install? Grab the portable [ZIP](https://github.com/adwatch1/sill-note/releases/latest/download/SillNote-Portable.zip), unzip it anywhere and run `Sill.exe`.

## Privacy

Your notes, images, audio and settings stay only on your computer. Sill Note goes online in one case only: when you paste a YouTube link, it downloads that video’s thumbnail and title once (you can turn this off in Settings → Privacy). The microphone is used only while you record. [Privacy policy](https://www.sillnote.store/privacy.html)
